Rippers Cloud is a cloud-powered brute-force simulation platform built for ethical hackers and security analysts to test password strength under controlled, legal conditions. 
Using distributed cloud computing, it can rapidly attempt large volumes of password combinations to evaluate system resilience. 
This service is strictly for environments where explicit permission has been granted, ensuring compliance with cybersecurity laws. 
Test results, including success rates and recommended mitigations, are securely sent to a connected Telegram channel for real-time monitoring. 
By simulating high-intensity attacks safely, Rippers Cloud helps organizations strengthen authentication systems and prepare against real-world cyber threats.
